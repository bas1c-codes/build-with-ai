# Project Name

## Problem Statement
Online scams and phishing attacks are increasing rapidly. Users often receive emails, messages, or links that look legitimate but are designed to steal sensitive information such as passwords, OTPs, and bank details.

Most users cannot easily identify malicious content, which leads to financial loss and privacy breaches.

## Project Description
This project is an AI-powered Scam & Phishing Detection System that analyzes text (emails, messages, or links) and determines whether it is safe or malicious.
⚙️ How it works:
User pastes text into the input box (email/message/link)
On clicking "Scan with AI", the system sends the text to an AI model
The AI analyzes:
Suspicious links
Urgency/threat language
Requests for sensitive data (OTP, password, bank info)
The system returns:
✔ Safe Content
⚠ Unsafe Content
🔥 Key Features:
Real-time scam detection
Phishing link identification
Clean UI with instant results
Can be extended into a browser extension (Gmail protection)

## Google AI Usage
### Tools / Models Used
Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
Google AI API
- 

### How Google AI Was Used
Google Gemini API is used as the core intelligence engine of the project.

The user input text is sent to Gemini
A structured prompt is used to guide the AI to detect:
Phishing attempts
Scam patterns
Malicious intent
Gemini returns a JSON response indicating whether the content is unsafe
The frontend parses this response and displays the result

This allows the system to understand context, not just keywords — making it far more powerful than traditional rule-based filters.
